A Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Browser Game Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.



-- Usage:

Simply Clone The Directory (Not The Entire Repo)
by Using the following method : 

$ git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/ahmadharbi0x1337/simple_projects_-1.git

$ cd simple_projects_-1/

$ git sparse-checkout init cone

$ git sparse-checkout set tic-tac-toe_web_js_html_css/

$ git checkout


This Way You Would Have Only Cloned The Directory and not the entire Repo
Additionally, if you care to know, this method allow you to work on the files you only want but actually just like if you were working on the entire repo, 
and i don't even know what that means yet !!!.


After Cloning you could just Open the index.html and Enjoy.





--The Js Code In it's Core
ComputerMove and BestMove Logic
The Logic Behind The O Computer Move is To Simply Check All The Winning Combinations And Act Based On it, it's not A.I offcourse , more like an exploit, but it's still idiot off-course and needs more effort to make it smart, because i have won a couple of times, cause the code put a random O at the start if the center is occupied. 






-- Some Notes For Me and People Who Care: 
There is actually a beauty in the ways you could call functions from different places, for example i could have called the animateWinner() from within the highlightWinner() , But do anybody really care ??? 



Just A Thought. 



PeaceOut ✌️..
